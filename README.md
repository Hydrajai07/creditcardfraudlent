💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection
A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using classification algorithms and data analysis techniques. The project is based on real-world anonymized data from European cardholders.

🧠 Problem Statement
Credit card fraud is a serious issue in the banking industry. The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions and help reduce financial losses.

📊 Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection

Records: 284,807 transactions
Fraud Cases: 492 (highly imbalanced dataset)

Features:
Numerical values transformed via PCA (V1, V2, ..., V28)
Time, Amount, and Class (target: 0 = legit, 1 = fraud)

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Type:	Stack
Language:	Python
Libraries:	NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
ML Models:	Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
Evaluation:	Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
Notebook:	Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📈 Workflow
Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values (if any)
Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
Handling class imbalance (SMOTE or undersampling)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizing class distribution
Correlation analysis
Transaction amount and time patterns
Model Building
Train/Test split
Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
Hyperparameter tuning
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy (not preferred due to imbalance)
Precision, Recall, F1 Score
ROC Curve and AUC

✅ Results
Achieved over 90% Recall on test data using Random Forest/XGBoost
Used SMOTE to balance the dataset and improve fraud detection sensitivity
ROC-AUC score of >0.95 on final model

📌 Challenges
Highly imbalanced dataset
Risk of overfitting due to few fraud samples
Need for metric selection beyond accuracy (e.g., Recall)

🚀 Future Improvements
Use Deep Learning (Autoencoders or LSTM)
Real-time fraud detection system
Deploy via Flask/Django API
Create interactive dashboard using Streamlit
